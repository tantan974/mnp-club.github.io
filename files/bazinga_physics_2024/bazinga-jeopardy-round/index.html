<!-- This is a simple UI for the Jeopardy round of Bazinga, the flagship quizzing competition of Maths and Physics Club, IIT Bombay. The UI is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The UI is designed to be used on a projector screen, with the host controlling the board using a laptop. The host can click on a cell to reveal the question, and click on the question to reveal the answer.
There are 6 categories, each with 3 questions of increasing difficulty. Each question can be opened exactly once. The host can click on a cell to reveal the question, and click on the answer button to reveal the answer. The host can then click next to go back to the board and select another question.
The app can be run by opening the `index.html` file in a browser. -->

Explain how to rotate it around the vertical axis by just modifying the rotation somehow of the four vertical propellers, without the need of any horizontal propellers?</div>`, answer: `<div class="answer-text">Initially all four propellers are in clockwise direction, now rotate two of the propellers at opposite corners in clockwise direction, and other two propellers at the other pair of opposite corners in anticlockwise direction .
