Okay, here's a note summarizing whatever I've managed to do till now. Tried to make it make sense chronologically, even though my brain is fried.

**Goal:** Take the MnP website and make it... somewhat prettier.

**Previous Knowledge:** I just learnt web developement this semester so I know what this stuff is but I'm not as comfortable I'd like to be, had to take a lot of help from AI.

## Progress till the first commit



**Current Status:**
*   Only the About Page is done. Baby steps.

**Process:**
1.  **Inspiration:** Scrolled through Reddit looking for threads discussing *aesthetic* websites.
2.  **Implementation (So Far):**
    *   Started thinking about what to do with the About Page, I guess after this page is done the rest will finish relatively quickly.
    *   Added an **"Upcoming Events"** section on the about page since its also like a main page of sorts. Seemed like a good idea.
    *   Implemented a **typewriter animation** for loading the page content. Because it looks cool, obviously.
    *   Added a lot of **hover effects** because that was the only thing simple enough for me to implement well.
    *   Changed colors, rearranged things, made the font thinner and other stuff I can't remember. 
    *   Added an **"Invert Color"** button for crazy light mode people, but ironically I have no choice but to load the page in light mode first before allowing users to toggle to dark mode because of some bug I tried hours to fix :( . 


**Overall:** It's... coming along, Slowly. The dark mode header bug is mocking me(hope no one notices but its hard to miss). But hey, hover effects.

## Progress till the third (second) commit

**Current Status:**
*   Finished two additional table based webpages (chronicles and events).

**Process:**
1.   Updated the stylesheet for tables using pastel-ish, aesthetic colors because the old one didn't pass the vibe check.
2.   Implemented **even more hover animations**, this time I toyed with increasing the font when user hovers over a table cell, doesn't look that great but works. 
3.   The dark mode button wasn't converting black font to white for some reason so I fixed that somehow.

**Overall:** I'm confident I'll get this thing finished.
