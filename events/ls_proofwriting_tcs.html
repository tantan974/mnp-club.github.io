            This course dives into the fundamental structures that underpin modern mathematics, revealing the beauty and power of groups in solving complex problems.
            <br>
            <br>
            Discover the elegance of mathematical reasoning in this immersive four-week course, where we unravel the core concepts of combinatorics, formal logic, elementary number theory, and proof techniques in general. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We will explore the rationale behind the development of proof-based mathematics and theoretical CS, and why as a student you should care about rigour in pure sciences. Some Extremal graph theory and Ramsey theory are also touched upon for a taste of industry computer science :)
